Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Ans:: Java Development kit. Composed of JRE, Complier, and Debugger.
                            JRE: Java Runtime Environment.
                            Complier: Translate source code into byte code.
    		                Debugger: Provide inspection and debugging.

What is IDE?
Ans:Integrated Development Environment.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Ans: Eclipse, Intellij, Net beans.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans:A java program will be written and complied by a java complier.
From there it will turn into .class, which than goes through the interpreter.
The translate the java code into binary machine code. This is then outputted to computer.

what is class?
Ans:A blueprint for creating objects.

What is object?
Ans:An entity that has state and behavior?

What is the entry point of an application?
Ans: The main method.

Why main is static?
Ans: When a java program execute, it looks like as public static void main method.
The reason main method is static ,
so that it could be called by JVM without creating an instance of the class.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Ans:Interface: 1.Interface can have only abstract methods
               2.A class can implement any number of interface.
               3.Interface class ca n have only public abstract method. i.e. by default
               4.Interface can extends any of interfaces at  time.
               5.Interface has a only static and final variable

   Abstract :  1.Abstract class has abstract and non-abstract methods.
               2.A class can extend only one abstract class.
               3.Abstract class can have protected , public, and public abstract methods
               4.Abstract class can extend only one class or one abstract class at a time.
               5.Abstract class can have final, non final, static and non static methods.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Ans:: No, A java abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked.
Any variable declare in the interface are final or constant.
One can create an instance of an anonymous subclass of your abstract class.
And then it could be invoked the method from  abstract class reference pointing to subclass object.

what is Access Specifier?
Ans:1.	Public: Easily access
    2.	Private: Members can only access
    3.	Protected: Can be access from same package and subclass existing in any package can access.
    4.	Default(No Specifier)


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Ans:OOP- Object Oriented Program.
    1.	Inheritance: Is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent class.
    2.	Abstraction: Implementation hiding
    3.	Polymorphism: It is an ability of an object to make on many form.
    Two types of polymorphism:
    1-	Method Overloading ? Happens on Compile time
    2-	Method Overriding?  Happens on Run time
    4.	Encapsulation: Data hiding


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Ans: API- Application programming interface.
          List of API:- Core java API, OSGI, JMF, Google, Android, SE, ME, JSP

Does java support multiple inheritance?
Ans: No. To reduce the complexity and simplify the language.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans: : If a class have a multiple methods by same name but different parameters,
it is known as method Overloading. Happen on compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans: In java exception are object. During the program compilation the execution of the program behaves unexpectedly,
exception occurred. Try-catch and throw exception two most popular way to handle exception.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans:The static keyword used for memory management mainly.
    Static variables: Static variable is used to refer the common property of all objects.
    		          Static variable gets memory only once in class area at the time of class loading.
    Static method:    A static method belongs to the class rater than object of a class.
                      A static method can be invoked without the need for creating as instance of class.



What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Ans:The final keyword in java is used to restrict the users.
    The java final keyword can be used in many contexts.
    Variable: If you make any final variable as final,
    you cannot change the value of final variable (It will be constant).
    Method: If you make any final method, you can override it.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Ans: Final: Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variables.
            Final class cannot be inherited,
            final method cannot be overridden, and final variable cannot be changed. And final is ?Keyword?.
    Finally:Finally is used to place important code,
            it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. And finally is ?Block?.
    Finalize:Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is grabbed collected.
             And Finalize is a ?Method?.
What is a constructor ?
Ans:Constructor is just like a method that is used to initialize the state of and object.
    It is invoked at the name of the object creation.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
Ans: There can be a lot of usage of java keyword.
     In java this is a reference variable that refers to the current object,
     and instance variable.

What is "super" keyword in java?
Ans:It is keyword that refers to the immediate parent class object.

What is JVM stand for ?
Ans: JVM: Java virtual machine.

What version of java are you using?
Ans: Java aversion ?1.8.0_131?

What is JAR stand for ?
Ans: Java Archive.

What is compile time and run time?
Ans: Compile time: A compile time error is a problem such as syntax error (example; }  )
                   or spelling mistake example (string), instead of String.
     Runtime:      A runtime error occurs while your program is running.
                   Sometimes this error can be tough to track down.

What is heap?
Ans:The heap section contains Object (May also contain reference variable)

How java manage it's memory?
Ans: Memory management is the process of allocating new
     objects and removing unused objects to make space for those new object allocations.
     This section presents some basic memory management concepts
     and explains the basics about object allocation and garbage collection.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Ans: String: String is an immutable class, it cannot be changed.
     StringBuffer: Is the original synchronized version of string Builder
     StringBuilder: String buffer is mutable class that can be appended to,
                    characters replaced or removed and ultimately converted.

What is Singleton class?
Ans: Singleton class:We can make constructor as private.
     So that We can not create an object outside of the class. T
     his property is useful to create singleton class in java.
     Singleton pattern helps us to keep only one instance of a class at any time.
     The purpose of singleton is to control object creation by keeping private constructor.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Ans:

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Ans:   Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
       Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to
       recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
Ans: In java, string objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.
     Once string object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new string object is created.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Ans:Calling a constructor from the another constructor of same class is known as Constructor chaining.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
Ans:both the serial and parallel collectors cause a stop-the-world during the GC.
    a serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation,
    while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.
    the parallel uses multiple GC threads, while the CMS uses only one.
    the parallel is a 'stop-the-world' collector, while the CMS stops the world only during the initial mark and remark phases.


What is JIT stands for?
Ans:JIT stands for Just In time compilation and JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
    JVM is a virtual machine used in Java programming platform to execute or run Java programs.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Ans:whenever we create an object using new operator or by any another means the
    object is allocated memory from Heap and When object dies or garbage collected, memory goes back to Heap space in Java,
    to learn more about garbage collection see how garbage collection works in Java.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
Ans:
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
