Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans: The reason for learning about data structure is because adding structure to our data can make the
     algorithms much simpler, easier to maintain, and often faster.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Ans: 1.Traversing- It is used to access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.
     2.Searching-  It is used to find out the location of the data item if
                   it exists in the given collection of data items.
     3. Inserting- It is used to add a new data item in the given collection of data items.
     4. Deleting-  It is used to delete an existing data item from the given collection of data items.
     5. Sorting-   It is used to arrange the data items in some order.
                   i.e. in ascending or descending order in case of
                   numerical data and in dictionary order in case of alphanumeric data.
      6. Merging-  It is used to combine the data items of two sorted files
                   into single file in the sorted form.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans:                 1. Compiler Design
                     2. Operating System
                     3. Database management system
                     4. Statistical analysis package
                     5. Numerical analysis
                     6. Artificial intelligence
                     8. Simulation

what is an Array?
Ans: A array is data structure where elements are stored sequentially ,
     elements can be retrieved randomly in  an array .

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: Array: Array is not dynamic
            Array has a fixed size
            Array is (length)
            Store only Primitives data types and objects
  ArrayList:array List is dynamic
            ArrayList does not have fixed size
            ArrayList(Size
            ArrayList only objects

what is LinkedList?
Ans: An order set of data elements , each containing a link to its successor(and sometimes its predecessor).

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Ans: Array: Array Fixed size,
            Array has a set of variable
    LinkedList: LinkedList uses doubly linked list
                LinkList is efficient for data manipulation
                LinkList is better for manipulate data.


what is queue?
Ans:Java Queue is an interface orders the element in FIFO (First In First Out) manner.
    In FIFO, first element is removed first and last element is removed at last.

what is stack?
Ans: Stack is a data structure. It is based on LIFO property means last in first out.
     It uses two operations on elements in the stack. Push for adding the elements in to the stack.
     Pop for removing the elements from the stack.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans: :     FIFO: - First in first out.
           LIFO: - Last in first out.

what is the order of complexity?
Ans: Is finding the upper limit for the growth of some function ,
     for example if our sort algorithm require a constant amount of extra space is space complexity is O(n).

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans: :  Depends if the desired element is the first element in the array then that case
        would be the best for searching element of an array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Ans: The worst case running time of an algorithm is the function defined by the
     maximum number of steps taken on any instance of size n.

what is tree in data structure?
Ans: A tree data structure is a powerful tool for organizing data objects based on keys.
     It is equally useful for organizing multiple data objects in terms of hierarchical relationships.
     Tree is a abstract data types.

what is graph in data structure?
Ans: Graph is a non linear data structure, contain of set of arrays and set of edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans: HashTable: HasTable is synchronized.
                HashTable cannot contain any null value and null key.
     HashMap:   HashMap is not synchronized.
                Hashmap can containn one null key and multiple null value.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
Ans: RDBMS: Array
     Network data mode1 : Graph
     Hierarchal data mode1 : Trees

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans: The arrayOutOfBound exception ,also known as java.lang.arrayIndexOutOfBund
      Exception is one of the most common errors in java programm. It occours when java
      program tries to access ans invaid index.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans:  1. Manually
      2. Array.copyOf()
      3. System.arraycopy()
      4. Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans: Array: Array is not a dynamic
            Array has fixed value
            Array has Length
            Array does not support generic
            Array is a primitives types objects
  LinkList: LinkedList uses doubly linked list
            Linklist is eddicient for data manupulation
            LinkList is better for manupulate data.

What is DFS and BFS?
Ans: DFS: Defth first search:   The aim of DFS algorithm is to traverse the graph in such a
                                way that is tries to go far from the root node.
                                Stack is used in the implementation of depth first search.
     BFS: Breadth first search: This very different approach for traversing the graph nodes.
                                The aim of BFS algorithm is to traverse the graph as close as possible
                                to the root node.
                                Queue is used in the implementation of the breadth first search

What is Recursion?
Ans: The idea of calling one function from another immedietly suggest the possiblety of a function
      calling itself. The function called mechanishm in java support this possibility
      which known as recursion.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Ans: Linear data structure: Linear data structure are which all the data are arrange in a sequence manner
     Example: LinkedList, stack, array, arrayLIst, Queue
     Non Linear Data structure: Non linear data structure which all the data structure manage random manner.
     Exaample: Trees, Graps

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans: Big O notation used in computer science to describe the performance of a complexity of an algorithm
     Big O specially describes the worst case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution
     time required  or the space used by an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Ans:  Selection Sort: 	Best:  ?(n^2)      Average: ?(n^2)	          Worst: O(n^2)
      Bubble Sort:	    Best:  ?(n)	       Average: ?(n^2)	          Worst: O(n^2)
      Insertion Sort:	Best : ?(n)	       Average: ?(n^2)	          Worst: O(n^2)
      Heap Sort:        Best:  ?(n log(n)) Average:	?(n log(n))       Worst: O(n log(n))
      Quick Sort:	    Best : ?(n log(n)) Average: ?(n log(n))       Worst:	O(n^2)
      Merge Sort:	    Best : ?(n log(n)) Average: ?(n log(n))       Worst:	O(n log(n)))
      Bucket Sort:	    Best:  ?(n+k)	   Average: ?(n+k)	          Worst:O(n^2)
